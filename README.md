# Collision-Analysis-Dashboard

Link to my dashboard: https://y8xpw7-oluwadunsin-agbolabori.shinyapps.io/fulldashboard-agbolabori/

I have created 3 custom tabs.  

My first custom tab (By Impairment) shows annual totals for crashes, injuries, and fatalities broken down by drug and alcohol usage.  

My second custom tab (By terrain) shows totals for crashes, injuries, and fatalities by age category, surface, and weather condition.  

My third custom tab (Extra viz) contains a bar chart/ histogram showing total injuries by year and a pie chart showing total fatalities by age category. Here, I observed that the Adult category account for the most fatalities caused by traffic accidents.
